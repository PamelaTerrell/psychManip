      <h1>The Psychology of Control</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Understanding Control in Human Relationships</h2>
        <p>
          Control plays a role in nearly every human interaction—from workplace hierarchies to intimate
          relationships. While some control is necessary for order and collaboration, manipulative control
          undermines autonomy, distorts reality, and can lead to psychological harm.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In romantic relationships</strong>, control often masquerades as love, concern, or passion.
          These patterns may not be overt, but their psychological impact can be profound.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Narcissism and Intimate Control</h2>
        <p>
          Narcissistic individuals often display intense idealization early in relationships, followed by
          emotional invalidation or withdrawal. Common control behaviors include gaslighting, love bombing,
          and isolation.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “Narcissists use control not only to dominate others but to protect themselves from perceived threats
          to their ego.” — Millon & Davis (1996)
