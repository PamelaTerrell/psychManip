      <h1>🕯️ When the Apology Doesn’t Matter Anymore</h1>
      <p>
        There was a time when your apology might have meant something.
      </p>
      <p>
        A time when the person you hurt would have given anything just to hear you say,
        “I’m sorry. I was wrong. I see what I did.”
      </p>
      <p>
        But that time passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, apologies only matter when they’re backed by truth, change, and self-awareness.
        And by the time most manipulators are ready to say sorry, they’ve already trained the people they hurt to distrust every word.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because how do you trust an apology from someone who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lied while looking you in the eyes?</li>
        <li>Turned your pain into a weapon?</li>
        <li>Made <em>you</em> feel crazy for noticing what they were doing?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can’t.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you’re here, reading this, wondering if it’s “about you”—maybe it is.
        And if you’ve finally realized what you did, then sit with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Don’t apologize to get them back.</strong><br />
        <strong>Don’t apologize to make yourself feel better.</strong><br />
        Apologize—<em>if you ever do</em>—because you’ve changed. Not because you want something.
      </p>
      <p>
        But understand this:
      </p>
      <p>
        For the survivor… they don’t need it anymore. They stopped waiting.
        They’ve healed enough to know that words from someone who once twisted the truth can’t give them peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        That peace? They found it on their own. Without you.
      </p>
