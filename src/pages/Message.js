      <h1>A Note for You</h1>
      <p>
        If you’re reading this, I want you to know something important: I love you. I love you for the person you are beneath everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life may have made it hard to trust or be open. Sometimes we build walls to protect ourselves, even if those walls push others away.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I believe you deserve kindness, healing, and connection. I believe in your ability to grow and change, even when it feels impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t about blame or judgment—it’s about hope and love. I’m here, and I care deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re not alone.
      </p>
    </div>
