      <h1>Trauma Bonding</h1>
      <p>
        Trauma bonding refers to the emotional attachment formed between an abuser and their victim
        through cycles of abuse and intermittent reinforcement. These bonds can be extremely difficult
        to break due to the psychological dependency that develops.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section discusses how trauma bonds form, their impact on victims, and how one can begin
        the journey of breaking free.
