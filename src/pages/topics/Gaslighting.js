      <h1>Gaslighting</h1>
      <p>
        Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where a person or group causes someone to
        question their memory, perception, or sanity. It’s a tactic frequently used in emotionally
        abusive relationships to gain power, deflect responsibility, and erode a person's confidence
        in their own judgment.
      </p>

      <h2>What Does Gaslighting Look Like?</h2>
      <p>
        Gaslighting typically involves a pattern of subtle (or overt) behaviors designed to make the
        target feel confused or “too sensitive.” Over time, the victim may begin to doubt their own
        experiences, beliefs, or emotional responses.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Gaslighting Tactics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Denial of Reality:</strong> Saying things like “That never happened,” or “You’re imagining things.”</li>
        <li><strong>Minimization:</strong> Downplaying hurtful behavior—“You’re overreacting” or “It was just a joke.”</li>
        <li><strong>Withholding:</strong> Refusing to engage in a conversation by pretending not to understand or feigning confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Countering:</strong> Questioning the victim’s memory even when it’s accurate—“You have a terrible memory.”</li>
        <li><strong>Discrediting:</strong> Telling others that the victim is unstable, irrational, or overly emotional.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Warning Signs You're Being Gaslit</h2>
      <p>You may be experiencing gaslighting if you regularly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Doubt your memory or perception of events</li>
        <li>Feel confused, anxious, or like you’re “walking on eggshells”</li>
        <li>Apologize often—even when you haven’t done anything wrong</li>
        <li>Make excuses for the other person’s behavior</li>
        <li>Feel like you’re “going crazy” or losing touch with reality</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Psychological Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Gaslighting can have lasting emotional effects. Prolonged exposure may lead to low self-esteem,
        chronic anxiety, depression, and even trauma responses like dissociation or hypervigilance.
        Many survivors report feeling isolated, powerless, and dependent on the abuser’s version of reality.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Resist Gaslighting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Document Events:</strong> Keep a journal or written record of interactions to track patterns and affirm your reality.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek Validation:</strong> Talk to trusted friends, family, or a therapist who can reflect reality back to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Boundaries:</strong> Establish clear limits on what behaviors are unacceptable and stick to them.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Grounded:</strong> Practice mindfulness or grounding techniques to stay connected to your inner truth.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Engage in Power Struggles:</strong> You don’t need to convince them—your clarity is enough.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Healing After Gaslighting</h2>
      <p>
        Healing from gaslighting takes time. It involves rebuilding self-trust, reconnecting with your
        sense of identity, and releasing internalized doubt or shame. Working with a trauma-informed
        therapist can help you untangle the mental fog and restore your confidence in your thoughts and emotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember, gaslighting is about control—not truth. You are not “too sensitive” for feeling hurt,
        and you deserve relationships grounded in mutual respect, not manipulation.
