      <p>
        Emotional coercion involves using fear, guilt, shame, or obligation to control another person's
        actions or decisions. It is a subtle yet powerful form of manipulation often present in toxic
        relationships and social dynamics.

      <p>
        On this page, we unpack the methods and motives behind emotional coercion and discuss how to
        identify, resist, and recover from its effects.
