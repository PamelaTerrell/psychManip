      <h1>Triangulation in Romantic Relationships</h1>

      <p>
        Triangulation is a psychological manipulation tactic in which a person draws a third party into the relationship dynamic to control, divide, or destabilize others. In the context of romantic relationships, it is frequently used to provoke jealousy, create rivalry, or avoid direct communication—often resulting in confusion, emotional harm, and dependency.
      </p>

      <h2>What Does Triangulation Look Like?</h2>
      <p>
        In romantic relationships—particularly those involving narcissistic behavior—triangulation occurs when a third person is intentionally drawn into the dynamic. This third party may be an ex-partner, a friend, a colleague, or even a family member. The narcissist uses this person to create tension, provoke jealousy, or validate their own perspective, subtly or overtly shifting the power dynamic in the relationship.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, a narcissist might frequently reference an ex in flattering terms (“They understood me in a way you never do”), or seek sympathy from a mutual friend by painting their partner as unstable or overly sensitive. This not only destabilizes the targeted partner emotionally but can also manipulate the third party into forming a biased view, often unknowingly contributing to the cycle of abuse.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result is a dynamic where the partner feels isolated, insecure, or even pitted against someone they don’t fully understand. At the same time, the third party may become an unwitting enabler—used as leverage, validation, or even a replacement—without being fully aware of the harm being done.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Is Triangulation Used?</h2>
      <p>
        Triangulation serves multiple purposes for the manipulator. It allows them to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deflect accountability:</strong> Blame is shifted, and direct communication is avoided.</li>
        <li><strong>Control perception:</strong> By controlling the narrative shared with each party, the manipulator maintains power.</li>
        <li><strong>Induce insecurity:</strong> The target often questions their worth and becomes more emotionally dependent.</li>
        <li><strong>Divide and conquer:</strong> Prevents unity or resistance between the manipulated individuals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples of Triangulation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A partner frequently brings up an ex in a romantic or idealized way to make you feel like you’re not enough.</li>
        <li>They tell you, “Everyone agrees you overreact,” without naming anyone specifically.</li>
        <li>They flirt with others in front of you and call you “jealous” when you express discomfort.</li>
        <li>They encourage competition between you and another person for their approval or attention.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Effects on the Target and the Third Party</h2>
      <p>
        The person being targeted may experience anxiety, jealousy, shame, and self-doubt. Over time, triangulation erodes self-esteem and reinforces emotional dependency on the manipulator. It also isolates the target, who may feel unable to trust the third party or speak openly without being dismissed or gaslit.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third party—who may be unaware of the manipulation—can be weaponized as a “flying monkey,” giving false validation or acting as a buffer. This enables the manipulator while deepening the dysfunction and emotional confusion for all involved.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Recognize and Respond</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recognize patterns:</strong> Pay attention to repeated involvement of others in personal conflicts or comparisons.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid competing:</strong> Refuse to engage in rivalry or seek approval that is being intentionally withheld.</li>
        <li><strong>Set clear boundaries:</strong> Express that you will not tolerate triangulating behavior or third-party commentary.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek clarity independently:</strong> Talk directly with others instead of relying on secondhand claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect your perspective:</strong> Therapy or journaling can help you sort reality from distortion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Understanding triangulation is a critical step in breaking free from emotional manipulation. Whether you are the target or the unwitting third party, awareness and boundaries are key to dismantling the dynamic and restoring healthy communication.
