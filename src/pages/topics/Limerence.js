        <h1>Limerence</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Limerence</strong> is an intense, involuntary emotional state characterized by obsessive infatuation with another person. Often mistaken for love, limerence is actually rooted in anxiety, idealization, and a deep yearning for emotional reciprocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike healthy affection, limerence tends to focus on the need for validation and the fear of rejection. It can create a cycle of hope and despair, marked by intrusive thoughts and heightened sensitivity to signs of reciprocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding limerence is important for recognizing unhealthy emotional attachments and fostering healthier, more balanced relationships.
        </p>

        <h2>Signs You May Be in Limerence</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Intrusive thoughts about the person</li>
          <li>Heightened sensitivity to their behavior or words</li>
          <li>Strong emotional highs and lows based on small interactions</li>
          <li>Fantasies about a future with them, despite little real closeness</li>
          <li>Craving signs of reciprocation — a reply, a look, a like</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Manipulators Exploit Limerence</h2>
        <p>
          Manipulators often know exactly how to trigger limerence. They mirror your values, future-fake promises, and create deep emotional highs early on. Then, they pull away — just enough to keep you chasing the initial spark.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Love bombing:</strong> Showering you with attention to create emotional dependency</li>
          <li><strong>Intermittent reinforcement:</strong> Hot and cold behavior to keep you hooked</li>
          <li><strong>Withholding affection:</strong> Igniting longing and self-doubt</li>
          <li><strong>Ambiguous language:</strong> Keeping you uncertain about their intentions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🕳️ When Ignoring You Triggers Limerence</h2>
        <p>
          Limerence doesn’t always come from connection — sometimes it’s born in the space where someone <em>used</em> to be. When you're ignored, your mind often tries to fill the silence:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Replaying past conversations</li>
          <li>Searching for hidden meanings or missed signs</li>
          <li>Obsessing over “what went wrong”</li>
          <li>Fantasizing about reconciliation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What hurts isn’t just the absence — it’s the <strong>emotional cliffhanger</strong> they leave you dangling from.
        </p>

        <h2>⚠️ Psychological Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Being ignored creates a dopamine crash, triggering a powerful urge to chase the person — not for who they are, but for the emotional relief their attention might bring. It’s a loop of:
          <br />
          <strong>Pain → Hope → Fantasy → Pain again.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          You’re not weak for feeling this. You’re not broken. Limerence happens to emotionally deep, introspective people who crave connection. The very traits that make you vulnerable also make you beautiful.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="quote-box">
          “The one who’s ignoring you isn’t the one who will soothe you. The peace you’re craving won’t come from their reply — it will come from reclaiming your own voice.”
        </blockquote>

        <h2>🌿 Breaking Free</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Shift focus from them to you — journaling, therapy, grounded routines</li>
          <li>Limit or cut off contact, if possible</li>
          <li>Stop romanticizing mixed signals — clarity is love, confusion is control</li>
          <li>Reclaim your reality — you don’t need to earn someone’s care</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Limerence is not love. It’s the <em>longing</em> for love projected onto someone who may never truly see you. And that longing deserves compassion — not shame.
