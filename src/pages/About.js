      <p>
        This site is dedicated to exploring the complex mechanisms of psychological manipulation through a scholarly lens. 
        Our goal is to provide clear, research-based information on topics such as narcissism, gaslighting, trauma bonding, 
        and emotional coercion, empowering readers to recognize and understand these dynamics in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that education is a powerful tool for awareness and healing, and this platform aims to serve as a reliable resource for anyone interested in the social and psychological aspects of manipulation.
