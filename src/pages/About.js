      <h1>About This Site</h1>

      <p>
        Psychological manipulation is real. It’s insidious, disorienting, and often invisible until it's too late. 
        This site exists to expose those patterns—to name them, understand them, and ultimately help dismantle them.
      </p>

      <p>
        I created this platform after being deeply deceived by someone I trusted. What followed was not just betrayal, 
        but a collapse of reality—questioning my own memory, my worth, even my instincts. If you're here, maybe you’ve 
        felt that too. If so, I want you to know: you are not crazy, and you are not alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a background in sociology, I explore manipulation not only through individual behavior but also through 
        power structures, social norms, and emotional systems. This site covers topics like narcissism, gaslighting, 
        trauma bonding, coercive control, and more—always with a focus on clarity, compassion, and evidence-based insight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're in the middle of a confusing relationship, processing a past experience, or just trying to make sense 
        of the psychological games people play—this is a place for truth, for learning, and for beginning to heal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for being here. Keep going. Keep asking questions. There’s power in naming what’s been done to you.
