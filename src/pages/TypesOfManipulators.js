        <p>
          Understanding the different types of manipulators can help you recognize patterns and protect yourself from

      <section>
        <h2>1. Overt Narcissist</h2>
        <p>
          The overt narcissist is characterized by grandiosity, entitlement, and a blatant disregard for othersâ€™ feelings.
          They manipulate through intimidation, gaslighting, and openly seeking control. Their lack of empathy often leads
          to aggressive or abusive behavior.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Covert Narcissist</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike the overt narcissist, the covert narcissist hides insecurity beneath a facade of humility or victimhood.
          They use subtle tactics such as passive-aggression, guilt-tripping, and the silent treatment to maintain control
          while avoiding confrontation.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>3. The Sociopath / Psychopath</h2>
        <p>
          Sociopaths and psychopaths lack a conscience and display superficial charm. They are often skilled deceivers who
          exploit others without remorse. Their manipulation can be dangerous, extending into criminal behaviors.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. The Wounded Manipulator</h2>
        <p>
          Often survivors of trauma themselves, wounded manipulators use emotional blackmail and victimhood to gain control.
          Their behaviors can be cyclical and self-sabotaging, reflecting deep insecurities beneath their manipulative actions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. The Victim-Based Manipulator</h2>
        <p>
          This type habitually plays the victim to avoid responsibility and manipulate others into caretaking roles.
          They exploit sympathy and guilt to maintain control in relationships.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Recognizing these manipulator types is a crucial step toward building awareness and setting healthy boundaries.
          Keep in mind that manipulators may exhibit traits from multiple types or shift their tactics as needed.
